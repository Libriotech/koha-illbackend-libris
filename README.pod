Koha ILL Backend for Libris ILL (used in Sweden).

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

The official documentation of the Libris ILL API is available here:
L<https://iller.libris.kb.se/librisfjarrlan/api/doc>

See the "docs" directory for more documentation on this ILL backend.

=head1 PROBLEM WITH SENDING MESSAGES IN KOHA 23.05.00,22.11.06,22.05.13 AND NEWER

Recent versions of Koha have changed how messages are enqued, which means it is
no longer possible to use the Libris backend to send out messages when receiving
ILLs. In practice, this means that if you choose to send either email or SMS
when an item is received, you will get a "500 Internal Server Error", and no
messages are queued.

This problem is present in the following versions of Koha, and in newer minor
versions of the affected major versions (so e.g. 22.11.06, 22.11.07, 22.11.08
etc are affected):

=over 4

=item * 23.05.00

=item * 22.11.06

=item * 22.05.13

=back

A fix has been made in the git branch called B<fix-enqueue>, so if your Koha is
affected by this problem, do not use the code from the B<master> branch, but
use the B<fix-enqueue> branch: 

  $ git checkout fix-enqueue

The same fix will be applied to the master branch in due time, but it is
considered to be too early yet, to avoid problems for sites that run versions of
Koha that are not yet affected.

=head1 MAJOR CHANGES

=over 4

=item * 2019-11-21: Add support for empty form.

=item * 2019-11-26: Add support for multiple sigils. PLEASE NOTE: This changes
the way settings for the Libris backend are stored, from koha-conf.xml to a
separate YAML file. Please see the F<docs/config.pod> for details on the new config.

=item * 2020-05-13: patron_id_field is added as an optional config variable. The
default remains to use the user_id from the Libris data to look up patrons based
on cardnumber, but with this variable the backend can be told to use e.g. userid
or borrowernumber.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT BRANCH (waiting)

The commits from the "waiting" branch have now been merged into the "master"
branch, since the changes in Koha they relied on have been merged into Koha
version 22.11. This means you need at least 22.11 to run the master branch.
