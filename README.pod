the way settings for the Libris backend are stored, from koha-conf.xml to a
separate YAML file. Please see the F<docs/config.pod> for details on the new config.

=item * 2020-05-13: patron_id_field is added as an optional config variable. The

on cardnumber, but with this variable the backend can be told to use e.g. userid
or borrowernumber.
