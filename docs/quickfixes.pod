Quick fixes that do not yet have permanent fixes in Koha, but can make the
ILL module behave better.

=head2 Bug 23391 - Hide finished ILL requests

L<https://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=23391>

If a library has a lot of ILL traffic, the list of finished ILL requests on
display in the main ILL request table will soon make that page forbiddingly
slow to load. This little fix hides the finished requests:

File: F</usr/share/koha/lib/Koha/REST/V1/Illrequests.pm>

 57     # Get all requests
 58     # If necessary, only get those from a specified patron
 59     my @requests = Koha::ILL::Requests->search({
 60         ( status => { 'not in' => 'IN_AVSL' } ),
 61         $args->{borrowernumber}
 62         ? ( borrowernumber => $args->{borrowernumber} )
 63         : ()
 64     })->as_list;

Line 60 has been added to hide the finished requests.

The fix for this has been incorporated into Koha 20.11.00.
