=head1 CONFIGURATION

Some tips on how to configure the Libris ILL backend.

=head2 System preferences

=over 4

=item * B<ILLModule> = Enable

=item * Use B<OpacHiddenItems> to hide the itemtypes given in B<ill_itemtype> and
B<ill_closed_itemtype> below from the OPAC. E.g.: "itype: [FJARRLAN, FJARRLANX]".

=back

=head2 koha-conf.xml

In this file you need to make sure you have set up a section called 
interlibrary_loans for the ILL stuff to work at all. Inside this section, you
need to add the following element:

  <yazgfs>
    <config>
      <interlibrary_loans>
        ...
        <libris_config>/path/to/config.yaml</libris_config>
      </interlibrary_loans>
    <config>
  <yazgfs>

=head2 config.yaml

A config file in YAML format that should contain the following data:

=over 4

=item * B<libraries> - A hash of hashes, where the "Libris sigil" (The sigil or
identifier used to identify the library in Libris.) acts as the key, and the
following values should be present for each entry:

=over 4

=item * B<libris_key> - The API key for talking to the Libris API. Swedish
libraries can look this up when they are logged into Libris.

=back

=item * B<unknown_patron> - borrowernumber for a dummy patron that can be used
if a connection to a real patron can not be established.

=item * B<unknown_biblio> - biblionumber of a dummy record that can be used
if a connection to a real biblio can not be established.

=item * B<ill_branch> - Library to tie imported dta about libraries to.

=item * B<ill_itemtype> - When items are created for ILL documents, use this
itemtype.

=item * B<ill_closed_itemtype> - Use this itemtype when an ILL is marked as
done. If you do not want to differentiate between items that are done and
items that are not done, set this to the same value as ill_itemtype.

=item * B<libris_borrowernumber> - A "fake" patron that can be used to add
automatic ILL comments.

=item * B<ill_callnumber> - A standard callnumber that will be added to all
items created by the ILL processes.

=item * B<update_library_data> - Data about ILL partner libraries is retrieved
from Libris. If a library has not been seen before, its data is saved as a new
patron in Koha. If update_library_data = 0, saved libraries are B<not> updated
when their data is fetched from Libris again. If update_library_data = 1, saved
libraries are updated.

=item * B<close_article_request_on_receive> - When an article/copy is received,
it can either be closed (record and item deleted, request anonymized) immediately
(close_article_request_on_receive = 1) or this can be left for later
(close_article_request_on_receive = 0). In the latter case, the request must be
manually closed ("Avslutad").

=back

Example:

  ---
  
  libraries:
    Ab:
      libris_key: cde
    Fg:
      libris_key: hij
  libris_borrowernumber: 123
  unknown_patron: 1
  unknown_biblio: 2
  ill_branch: FJARRLAN
  ill_itemtype: FJARRLAN
  ill_closed_itemtype: FJARRLANX
  ill_callnumber: Fjärrlån
  update_library_data: 0
  close_article_request_on_receive: 0

=head2 Notices

Add notices with the following codes under Tools > Notices and slips:

=over 4

=item * B<ILL_ANK_LAN> - For books and other media that are borrowed and returned.

=item * B<ILL_ANK_KOPIA> - For article copies that are not returned.

=back

NOTE: The codes for these notices are hardcoded in the Libris backend, so the
notices have to ba created with exactly these codes.

The following settings should apply to all notices:

=over 4

=item * B<Library>: All libraries

=item * B<Koha module>: Circulation

=head2 Temporary hacks

On around line 526 of Koha/Illrequest.pm change this:

    foreach my $backend_status_key ( keys %{$backend_status_graph} ) {
        my $backend_status = $backend_status_graph->{$backend_status_key};
        # Add to new status graph
        $status_graph->{$backend_status_key} = $backend_status;
        # Update all core methods' next_actions.
        foreach my $prev_action ( @{$backend_status->{prev_actions}} ) {
            if ( grep $prev_action, @core_status_ids ) {
                my @next_actions =
                     @{$status_graph->{$prev_action}->{next_actions}};
                push @next_actions, $backend_status_key;
                $status_graph->{$prev_action}->{next_actions}
                    = \@next_actions;
            }
        }
        # Update all core methods' prev_actions
        foreach my $next_action ( @{$backend_status->{next_actions}} ) {
            if ( grep $next_action, @core_status_ids ) {
                my @prev_actions =
                     @{$status_graph->{$next_action}->{prev_actions}};
                push @prev_actions, $backend_status_key;
                $status_graph->{$next_action}->{prev_actions}
                    = \@prev_actions;
            }
        }
    }

into this:

    foreach my $backend_status_key ( keys %{$backend_status_graph} ) {
        my $backend_status = $backend_status_graph->{$backend_status_key};
        # Add to new status graph
        $status_graph->{$backend_status_key} = $backend_status;
        # Update all core methods' next_actions.
        foreach my $prev_action ( @{$backend_status->{prev_actions}} ) {
            if ( grep $prev_action, @core_status_ids ) {
                my @next_actions =
                     @{$status_graph->{$prev_action}->{next_actions}} if $status_graph->{$prev_action}->{next_actions};
                push @next_actions, $backend_status_key;
                $status_graph->{$prev_action}->{next_actions}
                    = \@next_actions;
            }
        }
        # Update all core methods' prev_actions
        foreach my $next_action ( @{$backend_status->{next_actions}} ) {
            if ( grep $next_action, @core_status_ids ) {
                my @prev_actions =
                     @{$status_graph->{$next_action}->{prev_actions}} if $status_graph->{$next_action}->{prev_actions};
                push @prev_actions, $backend_status_key;
                $status_graph->{$next_action}->{prev_actions}
                    = \@prev_actions;
            }
        }
    }

=head2 Tips and tricks

=head3 Hide the "Create a new request" button in OPAC

Libris ILL does not allow patrons to create requests from the OPAC, so we can
just hide this button, by adding the following to the OPACUserCSS syspref:

  #ill-backend-dropdown { display: none; }

=head3 Hide some ILL metadata elements in the OPAC

Elements under "Details from library" can be hidden with OPACUserJS:

  .requestattr-Melding  { display: none; }
  .requestattr-Libris   { display: none; }

Elements under "Details from Libris" can be hidden with OPACUserCSS:

  $("label[for='backend']").parent().hide();
  $("label[for='medium']").parent().hide();
  $("label[for='placed']").parent().hide();
